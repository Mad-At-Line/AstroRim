## Abstract

Gravitational lensing can be viewed as a powerful natural telescope to observe distant galaxies, but inverting lensing distortions remains a complicated previously unsolved inverse problem. We present **AstroRim**, a Recurrent Inference Machine (RIM) jointly trained with a differentiable forward lensing operator, to reconstruct unlensed source plane images from simulated strong lens observations. Using a 120,000+ sample synthetic dataset with complex multi-component lens models (SIE + NFW + SIS + External Shear) and extended Sérsic sources at 64×64 resolution, AstroRim achieves a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of **0.95 ± 0.02** and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of **4.7×10⁻⁴** on unseen test data. We demonstrate stability improvements via mixed precision, gradient clipping, and EMA, and discuss pathways towards real data application on HST, JWST, and Euclid imagery.

## 1. Introduction

Gravitational lensing by massive foreground objects distorts and magnifies background sources, enabling high-resolution studies of distant galaxies. However, inverting these distortions is challenging: multiple source configurations can produce identical lensed images. Traditional parametric inversion methods are computationally expensive, sensitive to model assumptions, and lack generalization.

Recent advances in deep learning, particularly RIMs and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), offer data-driven inversion by iteratively refining source estimates through learned gradient steps. Most prior work uses fixed forward operators or pretrained physics models, which can overfit. We propose **AstroRim**, which **jointly trains** the RIM and a differentiable CNN-based lensing operator end-to-end.

### 1.1 Contributions

- **Joint RIM + Physics Operator**: End-to-end training of both modules for consistent gradient flow.
- **Complex Simulations**: Multi-component lenses (SIE + NFW + SIS + Shear) with 1–3 Sérsic sources.
- **Stability Enhancements**: Mixed precision, gradient clipping, EMA, and LR warmup.
- **Quantitative Benchmarks**: High SSIM and low MSE on synthetic test data.
- **Extended Loss Tracking**: SSIM and MSE monitored across training, with best/worst-case metrics.

## 2. Related Work

- **RIMs**: Applied in MRI and deconvolution; Morningstar et al. (2019) applied to lensing with fixed forward models.
- **Physics-Informed ML**: Differentiable simulators (Caustics, Lenstronomy) used to embed physical laws.
- **Alternative Approaches**: CNN regression (Hezaveh et al. 2017) and variational inference methods—fast but lower source detail recovery.

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Simulation Pipeline
- Lens models: SIE + NFW + SIS + Shear via Lenstronomy.
- Sources: 1–3 Sérsic profiles with varied amplitude, size, ellipticity, and position.
- Grid: 64×64 pixels, normalized coordinates [-1,1].
- Dataset: 20k pairs (16k train, 4k val), noise-free; 250-pair test set.

### 3.2 Model Architecture
- Forward Operator: CNN (Conv 9×9 → ReLU → Conv 5×5 → ReLU → Conv 3×3).
- RIM Core: Gated Conv RNN (hidden_dim=96), 15 inference iterations.
- Loss: MSE primary, SSIM tracked; per-image metrics monitored.

### 3.3 Training Strategy
- Optimizer: AdamW + LR warmup (10% epochs) + ReduceLROnPlateau.
- Stabilization: AMP, gradient clipping (max_norm=5), EMA (0.999).
- Hardware: 6GB GPU, 150 epochs, evaluation every 5 epochs.

**Metrics:** SSIM = 0.95 ± 0.02, MSE = 4.7×10⁻⁴ on test data.  
**Visuals:** High-fidelity reconstructions matching ground truth across varied lenses and sources.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Comparison to Morningstar et al. (2019)
Morningstar used fixed forward models; AstroRim co-trains the physics operator for better adaptability and generalization.

### 5.2 Stability vs. Capacity
- 96-dim RIM = higher SSIM, near hardware limits.
- 64-dim RIM = more stable training.
- Joint training accelerates convergence but can oscillate—mitigated with AMP, EMA, gradient clipping.

### 5.3 Limitations & Future Improvements
- No PSF/noise modeling yet.
- Synthetic-to-real gap remains.
- Plans: add PSF/noise, scale to higher resolutions, real HST/JWST validation.

---

## 6. Future Work
- Add realistic PSF convolution and noise injection.
- Scale to 128×128 and multi-band images.
- Validate on real HST/JWST datasets.
- Add uncertainty estimation and RGB channels.
- Expand RIM capacity with more resources.

---

## 7. Conclusion
AstroRim shows that jointly training a RIM with a forward operator yields high-fidelity delensing. With real data validation, it could be a valuable astrophysical imaging tool.
